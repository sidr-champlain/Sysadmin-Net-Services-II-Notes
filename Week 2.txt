DHCP on Ad01: Today for our Lab I installed and configured DHCP on Windows ad01. The installation was pretty straight forward. I chose the windows a01 since it's easier to setup instead of Pfsense. To configure it successfully you need to have the right IP scopes, Subnet Mask, and Default Gateway.   


Important Note: If you have your DNS and DHCP Server on one machine, the IP address will be the same in CMD. Example: 10.0.5.5 for both DHCP and DNS Server. If you did it on a separate machine the address would be different.
