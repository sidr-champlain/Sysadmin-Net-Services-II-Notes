Lab: Git and SHH Script


Overview: 


This week  you do have a challenging lab and a scripting assignment that will involve docker01 and web01.


Scripting is a valuable part of any sysadmin's toolkit. You have been exposed to bash during both web01 and docker01 labs.


Prerequisites:


Version control systems are prevalent in today's IT environments.  A firm knowledge of how to store different iterations of critical configurations and source code is therefore important.


Install Git: apt install git


Git allows users to clone repositories and update them using the command line interface. 
Useful Commands:


* Git push
* Git pull 
* Git commit 
* Git config
* Git add .


My repo example for this lab is /docker-repo/sys/docker01


So all my information for the docker lab has been in this folder on my github. All documents about docker01 can be found there. 


You can use Git on windows to connect with linux machines through git. You can pull github repositories, push (update) and clone meaning copy the last updated form. 


The latest security fix for github is now personal tokens are a must have in order to clone from a private repository. This makes it so connections over https can’t be used to allow for more security.


Hardening SSH:


Manually added a user for ssh without password:


* Useradd -m -d /home/sys265 -s /bin/bash sys265
* Mkdir /home/sys265/.ssh
* Cp sys265/linux/public-keys/id_rsa.pub /home/sys265/.ssh/authorized_key
   * The above command takes the key I created dform web01 and adds the user sys265 to passwordless credentials. It uses the private and public key
* Chmod 700 /home/sys265/.ssh
* Chmod 600 /home/sys265/.ssh/authorized_keys
* Chown -R sys265:sys265 /home/sys265/.ssh


The created script for this is on Github as well.
